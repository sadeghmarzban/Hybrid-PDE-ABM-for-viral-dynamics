# Hybrid PDE-ABM model for viral dynamics

In order to model in-host viral dynamics, we have developed a hybrid PDE-Agent-Based-Model (PDE-ABM) spatiotemporal system, where virus concentration is modeled as a continuous variable. At the same time, for the case of epithelial cells, we take a discrete spatial approach. 
This repository contains our implementation of this model in the manuscript "A hybrid PDE-ABM model for viral dynamics with application to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza," based on a free and open-source software package, HAL (Hybrid Automata Library) [1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007635). In order to run this model, you'll need to download the latest version of [HAL](https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL.git), Java, and an editor. Using the code of this repository or using a result of a computation done by this code, manuscript [2] should be cited.
